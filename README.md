### Create custom light sequences for your model or antique signal using a Raspberry Pi and relay module card

piSignalSequencer provides a command line and web interface to display a sequence of lights on a model or museum-type signal display from a Raspberry Pi, meaning you can do so over WiFi from a mobile phone, or any browser on your local network. With the press of a button, you can change the aspect (lights displayed), run fixed and random light sequences consisting of aspects of your choosing, and more.

The signal must be physically wired to the Raspberry Pi via a relay module card, making this software useful for model railroads, home traffic signal displays, or antique museum-type signal exhibits where you want to loop through a pre-defined series of aspects.
